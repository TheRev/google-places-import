# Google Places Directory - Leaflet Maps Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Leaflet maps functionality was not working properly due to a missing JavaScript variable `gpdFrontendVars` that is required by both:
- `assets/js/gpd-frontend.js` (line 178, 183)
- `assets/js/gpd-leaflet-maps.js` (line 229, 244, 252)

## Root Cause
The `enqueue_assets()` method in `includes/class-gpd-shortcodes.php` was not properly localizing the `gpdFrontendVars` variable that the frontend scripts depend on for AJAX functionality.

## Fix Applied
**File Modified:** `includes/class-gpd-shortcodes.php`

**Changes Made:**
1. Added proper script localization for `gpdFrontendVars` in the `enqueue_assets()` method
2. Removed unused `gpdLeafletAjax` localization that wasn't being used anywhere
3. Used the correct nonce name (`gpd_leaflet_nonce`) that matches what the AJAX handler expects

**Code Added:**
```php
// Localize script with AJAX data for frontend functionality
wp_localize_script('gpd-frontend', 'gpdFrontendVars', array(
    'ajaxurl' => admin_url('admin-ajax.php'),
    'nonce' => wp_create_nonce('gpd_leaflet_nonce')
));
```

## Technical Details
- **Variable Name:** `gpdFrontendVars`
- **Localized to Script:** `gpd-frontend`
- **Contains:** AJAX URL and security nonce
- **Used For:** AJAX requests for surrounding businesses feature in Leaflet maps

## Files Verified
✅ `includes/class-gpd-shortcodes.php` - No syntax errors
✅ `includes/class-gpd-leaflet-ajax.php` - No syntax errors
✅ AJAX handler properly expects `gpd_leaflet_nonce`
✅ Script dependencies are correctly configured

## Testing
- Created test file: `test-wordpress-shortcode.php` for WordPress environment testing
- Verified that all required scripts are properly enqueued when shortcodes are used
- Confirmed that the `business_map_shortcode` function enqueues all necessary assets

## Result
The Leaflet maps should now work properly with:
- ✅ Proper marker display
- ✅ Popup functionality
- ✅ Surrounding businesses AJAX loading
- ✅ No JavaScript console errors for missing `gpdFrontendVars`

## Files Created/Modified
1. **Modified:** `includes/class-gpd-shortcodes.php` - Added missing script localization
2. **Created:** `test-wordpress-shortcode.php` - Test file for WordPress environment
3. **Created:** `LEAFLET_MAPS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Test the `[gpd-business-map]` shortcode in a WordPress environment
2. Verify that AJAX requests for surrounding businesses work correctly
3. Confirm that no JavaScript console errors occur
4. Test with different map configurations (clustering, zoom levels, etc.)
